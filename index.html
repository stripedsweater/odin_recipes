        <h2>Baked Spaghetti</h2>
        <img src="images/bakedspaghetti.jpg">        
        <p>A comforting baked spaghetti casserole with plenty of melted cheese is the perfect dish for potlucks, family gatherings, or a week-night dinner.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 jar meatless spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 cups small curd cottage cheese, divided</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

            <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>

            <li> Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir beef and onion until meat is browned and onions are soft and translucent, about 7 minutes. Drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned salt.</li>

            <li> Whisk eggs, Parmesan cheese, and butter in a large bowl. Mix in spaghetti to egg mixture and toss to coat. Place half the spaghetti mixture into baking dish. Top with half the cottage cheese, mozzarella, and meat sauce. Repeat layers. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>

            <li> Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until the cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes longer.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Baked Mac and Cheese</h2>
        <img src="images/macandcheese.jpg">
        <p>This is a rendition of a macaroni and cheese dish a local restaurant makes. It's so rich and decadent I only make it once per year. It's not a "dieter's friend". You can use any pasta shape you like.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups penne pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 Oaxaca cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cream, half-and-half, and garlic salt. Add Gruyere cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Oaxaca cheese. Stir into cream until melted. Drain pasta and add to the sauce; stir to coat.</li>

            <li>Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray and pour in pasta mixture. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and slightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>

        <h2>Chicken and Dumplings</h2>
        <img src="images/chickendumplings.png">
        <p>I wanted the richness of long-simmered chicken stew, but without the fuss of using a whole chicken. This compromise, using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast, gave me the richness of flavor and ease of preparation I was looking for! It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather than an oven. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced celery</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 pound bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon thyme</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 frozen petite peas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen cut green beans</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dumplings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant PotÂ®) and select the Saute function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>

            <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool slightly; discard bay leaf.</li>

            <li>Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside.</li>

            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl for the dumplings. Cut in cold butter until mixture is the texture of cornmeal. Stir in parsley and set aside.</li>

            <li>Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add peas and green beans. Stir in the flour-butter paste. Select Saute function to bring broth back to a boil.</li>
            
            <li>Pour buttermilk into the dumpling mixture and stir until combined. Drop the dumpling dough by heaping spoonfuls on top of the stew; a small cookie scoop works well.</li>

            <li>Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered, until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. A skewer inserted in the center of a dumpling should come out clean.</li>
        </ol>
